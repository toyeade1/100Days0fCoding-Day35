# 100Days0fCoding-Day35


Utilized the twilio API as well as the weatherapp API to create a weather checker that runs on PythonAnywhere servers and alerts the user through a text to their phone what the weather will be the next day for the hours of 7am to 6pm which would be the times that they go out. On the pythonAnywhere server I added an else statement where it would taxt and alert the user if there were clear skies. That way there will be daily conformation as to whether the program is running smoothly
